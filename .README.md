# Predictive Maintenance Framework for Vehicle Fleets

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive maintenance framework for enhancing the reliability and real-time monitoring of heavy and commercial vehicle fleets using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Predict potential component failures using historical sensor data
- Compare traditional ML models with deep learning architectures
- Enable real-time inference for maintenance decision support

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available industrial datasets relevant to predictive maintenance and vehicle systems.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment-ready pipeline design

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Git & GitHub
- Docker
